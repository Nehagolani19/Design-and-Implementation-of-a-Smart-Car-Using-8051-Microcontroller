# Bluetooth-Controlled Car using 8051 Microcontroller

This project demonstrates how to control a robotic car wirelessly using a **Bluetooth module (HC-05)** and an **8051 microcontroller (AT89C51)**. Commands sent from a smartphone are received over UART and translated into motor movements via the **L293D motor driver**.

## üß† Working Principle

1. The **Bluetooth module** receives characters ('F', 'B', 'L', 'R', 'S') from a mobile app.
2. These commands are transmitted via UART to the 8051.
3. The microcontroller interprets each command and sets the motor control pins accordingly.
4. The **L293D driver** receives these signals and drives the DC motors to move the car.

## üíª Code Summary

### Command Mappings

| Command | Motor 1  | Motor 2  | Action         |
|---------|----------|----------|----------------|
| 'F'     | Forward  | Forward  | Move Forward   |
| 'B'     | Backward | Backward | Move Backward  |
| 'L'     | Backward | Forward  | Turn Left      |
| 'R'     | Forward  | Backward | Turn Right     |
| 'S'     | Off      | Off      | Stop           |

### Functional Blocks

- **`motor_forward()`**: Drives both motors forward
- **`motor_backward()`**: Drives both motors backward
- **`motor_left()` / `motor_right()`**: Executes turn via short delay and motor halt
- **`motor_stop()`**: Halts both motors
- **`bluetooth_init()`**: Initializes UART settings for 9600 baud
